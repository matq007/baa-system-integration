# system-integration

This repository is primarily for my class mates from school. You can find here exercises that we had to implement. I was using JAVA
with ActiveMQ running on OSX. The patterns are used from book Enterprise Integration Patterns: Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions.
A lot of code is gathered from internet sites focused in this topics.

## Installation

First you need to install JAVA 7. After installing JAVA make sure it is in PATH.
I am using ActiveMQ messaging system and CAMEL for routing.
```
  brew install activemq
  brew install camel
```
